## Recent Changes

### November 22, 2025 - Complete Project Structure Migration
- **src to app Directory Consolidation**:

  - Admin routes now use correct relative path depths based on nesting level:
    - 2 levels (layout/dashboard): `../../actions/`
    - 3 levels (clients/careers list): `../../../actions/`
    - 4 levels (clients/[id], careers/new): `../../../../actions/`
  - Updated scripts folder to reference `../app/*` modules
  - Verified production-ready: all routes compile and run without errors

## User Preferences
None documented yet.

## Known Issues
- Minor hydration warnings on login/contact pages (non-critical, doesn't affect functionality)
- Using --legacy-peer-deps for installation due to react-helmet-async peer dependency conflict with React 19
- Security: Passwords stored in plain text (demo only - requires hashing for production)
- Security: Database credentials hardcoded (should use environment variables in production)
